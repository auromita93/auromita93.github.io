            Collaboration and teamwork are the keys to systems thinking <br>
            For our ecosystem deserves to be preserved and protected <br>
            Sustainability is a concept that will no longer be neglected <br>
            Instead of using fossil fuels, emitting greenhouse gas <br>
            Why don't we turn to plants for energy, in the form of biomass? <br>
            Nonrenewable sources increase our air pollution <br>
            Algae, waste, and sugarcane are the new energy solutions! <br>
            As we transition into energy that will be renewable <br>
            We need products from material that are green and reusable <br>
            From plastics made with sugar to plant oils to make soap <br>
            These bioproducts of the future give our economy and environment hope <br>
            With climate change becoming a threat, each day at a higher degree <br>
            Let's start creating bioproducts and producing bioenergy!
